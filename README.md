## Pong-Man

**Developed by Euclides Araujo**

This game is a cross-over of Pac-Man and Pong, both very old games and that are still fun today.

The gameplay is basically the same as pong, but by switching the pong ball for the Pong-Man (Pac-Man doppelganger) gives it the ability to eat the dots that are randomly placed in the game world.
So if the player hits Pong-Man and it eats a dot afterward, the player is rewarded an additional point. Thus making the game more fun, it's possible to win even if none of the players let Pong-Man pass through them.
The first player to reach 10 points win the match.
There is a scoreboard and a button to reset the game.

Player 1 is controlled by W and S keys, moving the paddle up or down.
Player 2 is controlled by UP and DOWN keys, moving the paddle up or down.

Press Esc to quit the application at any time.
